# Tandem Trivia Quiz App

This app was created as an application submission for Tandem's Apprentiship Program.

The game title and Tandem logo are also links to Tandem's website.

To begin, click/press the "Start Game" button.

The user is greeted with a random question and four answers presented in a random order. Clicking on an answer will reveal the "Next Quetion" button.

With each press of the "Next Question" button, the question number will increase by one and the user will be presented with a new, non-repeating, random question.

Once the user has answered ten questions, the "Next Question" button will disappear to be replaced with a "See Results" button.

Clicking the "See Results" button will take the user to the results page where they can view the percentage of questions they got right as well as a button that will allow the user to play the game again.
